[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You are given an array a of n integers and a set B of m positive integers such that 1 â‰¤b_i â‰¤âŒŠn/2 âŒ‹for 1â‰¤iâ‰¤m, whereb_i is the i-th element of B.
[0m
    You can make the following operation on a:
[0m
     Select some x such that x appears in B.
[0m
     Select an interval from array a of size x and multiply by -1 every element in the interval. Formally, select l and r such that 1â‰¤lâ‰¤r â‰¤nand r-l+1=x, then assign a_i:=-a_i for every i such that lâ‰¤iâ‰¤r.
[0m
    Consider the following example, let a=[0,6,-2,1,-4,5] and B={1,2}:
[0m
     [0,6,-2,-1,4,5] is obtained after choosing size 2 and l=4, r=5.
[0m
     [0,6,2,-1,4,5] is obtained after choosing size 1 and l=3, r=3.
[0m
    Find the maximum âˆ‘_i=1^n a_i you can get after applying such operation any number of times (possibly zero).
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤10^5) â€” the number of test cases. Description ofthe test cases follows.
[0m
    The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2â‰¤n â‰¤10^6, 1 â‰¤m â‰¤âŒŠn/2 âŒ‹) â€” the number of elementsof a and B respectively.
[0m
    The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,â€¦,a_n (-10^9â‰¤a_i â‰¤10^9).
[0m
    The third line of each test case contains m distinct positive integers b_1,b_2,â€¦,b_m (1 â‰¤b_i â‰¤âŒŠn/2 âŒ‹) â€” the elementsin the set B.
[0m
    It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each test case print a single integer â€” the maximum possible sum of all a_i after applying such operation any number of times.
