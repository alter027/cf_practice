[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    Igor is in 11th grade. Tomorrow he will have to write an informatics test by the strictest teacher in the school, Pavel Denisovich.
[0m
    Igor knows how the test will be conducted: first of all, the teacher will give each student two positive integers a and b (a < b). After that, thestudent can apply any of the following operations any number of times:
[0m
     a := a + 1 (increase a by 1),
[0m
     b := b + 1 (increase b by 1),
[0m
     a := a  |  b (replace a with the bitwise OR of a and b).
[0m
    To get full marks on the test, the student has to tell the teacher the minimum required number of operations to make a and b equal.
[0m
    Igor already knows which numbers the teacher will give him. Help him figure out what is the minimum number of operations needed to make a equal to b.
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤10^4). Description of the test cases follows.
[0m
    The only line for each test case contains two integers a and b (1 â‰¤a < b â‰¤10^6).
[0m
    It is guaranteed that the sum of b over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each test case print one integer â€” the minimum required number of operations to make a and b equal.
