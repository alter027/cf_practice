[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You have an array of integers a of size n. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 1. You can perform the following operation: choose twointegers i (1 â‰¤i â‰¤n) and x (x > 0), and then increase the value of a_i by âŒŠa_i/xâŒ‹(i.e. make a_i = a_i +âŒŠa_i/xâŒ‹).
[0m
    After performing all operations, you will receive c_i coins for all such i that a_i = b_i.
[0m
    Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than k operations.

[34m    Input:
[0m
    The first line contains a single integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤100)Â â€” the number of test cases.
[0m
    The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 â‰¤n â‰¤10^3; 0 â‰¤k â‰¤10^6)Â â€” the size of the array and the maximum number ofoperations, respectively.
[0m
    The second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, â€¦, b_n (1 â‰¤b_i â‰¤10^3).
[0m
    The third line contains n integers c_1, c_2, â€¦, c_n (1 â‰¤c_i â‰¤10^6).
[0m
    The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each test case, print one integerÂ â€” the maximum number of coins that you can get by performing no more than k operations.
