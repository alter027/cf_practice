[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You are given an array a consisting of n distinct positive integers.
[0m
    Let's consider an infinite integer set S which contains all integers x that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
[0m
     x = a_i for some 1 â‰¤i â‰¤n.
[0m
     x = 2y + 1 and y is in S.
[0m
     x = 4y and y is in S.
[0m
    For example, if a = [1,2] then the 10 smallest elements in S will be {1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12}.
[0m
    Find the number of elements in S that are strictly smaller than 2^p. Since this number may be too large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    The first line contains two integers n and p (1 â‰¤n, p â‰¤2 Â·10^5).
[0m
    The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,â€¦,a_n (1 â‰¤a_i â‰¤10^9).
[0m
    It is guaranteed that all the numbers in a are distinct.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    Print a single integer, the number of elements in S that are strictly smaller than 2^p. Remember to print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
