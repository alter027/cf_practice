[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You are given two arrays a and b, both of length n.
[0m
    You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): select an index i (1 â‰¤i â‰¤n) and swap a_i and b_i.
[0m
    Let's define the cost of the array a as âˆ‘_i=1^n âˆ‘_j=i + 1^n (a_i + a_j)^2. Similarly, the cost of the array b is âˆ‘_i=1^nâˆ‘_j=i + 1^n (b_i + b_j)^2.
[0m
    Your task is to minimize the total cost of two arrays.
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    Each test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤40)Â â€” the number of test cases. The followingis a description of the input data sets.
[0m
    The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 â‰¤n â‰¤100)Â â€” the length of both arrays.
[0m
    The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (1 â‰¤a_i â‰¤100)Â â€” elements of the first array.
[0m
    The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, â€¦, b_n (1 â‰¤b_i â‰¤100)Â â€” elements of the second array.
[0m
    It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 100.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each test case, print the minimum possible total cost.
