[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You are given an array a of n elements. You can apply the following operation to it any number of times:
[0m
     Select some subarray from a of even size 2k that begins at position l (1â‰¤l â‰¤l+2Â·k-1â‰¤n, k â‰¥1) and for each i between 0 and k-1(inclusive), assign the value a_l+k+i to a_l+i.
[0m
    For example, if a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3], then choose l = 1 and k = 2, applying this operation the array will become a = [3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3].
[0m
    Find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make all the elements of the array equal.
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤2 Â·10^4) â€” the number of test cases.Description of the test cases follows.
[0m
    The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 â‰¤n â‰¤2 Â·10^5) â€” the length of the array.
[0m
    The second line of each test case consists of n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (1 â‰¤a_i â‰¤n) â€” the elements of the array a.
[0m
    It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â·10^5.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case â€” the minimum number of operations needed to make equal all the elements
	of the array with the given operation.
