[34m    Problem Statement:
[0m
    You are given an array a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n, consisting of n integers. You are also given an integer value x.
[0m
    Let f(k) be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of a after applying the following operation: add x to the elements on exactly k distinctpositions. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum 0.
[0m
    Note that the subarray doesn't have to include all of the increased elements.
[0m
    Calculate the maximum value of f(k) for all k from 0 to n independently.
[0m
[34m    Input:
[0m
    The first line contains a single integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤5000)Â â€” the number of testcases.
[0m
    The first line of the testcase contains two integers n and x (1 â‰¤n â‰¤5000; 0 â‰¤x â‰¤10^5)Â â€” the number of elements in the array and the valueto add.
[0m
    The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (-10^5 â‰¤a_i â‰¤10^5).
[0m
    The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000.
[0m
[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each testcase, print n + 1 integersÂ â€” the maximum value of f(k) for all k from 0 to n independently.
