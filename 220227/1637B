[0m
    Let there be an array b_1, b_2, â€¦, b_k. Let there be a partition of this array into segments [l_1; r_1], [l_2; r_2], â€¦, [l_c; r_c], wherel_1 = 1, r_c = k, and for any 2 â‰¤i â‰¤c holds that r_i-1 + 1 = l_i. In other words, each element of the array belongs to exactly one segment.
[0m
    Let's define the cost of a partition as c + âˆ‘_i = 1^c mex({b_l_i, b_l_i + 1, â€¦, b_r_i}), where mexof a set of numbers S is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set S. In other words, the cost of a partition is the number ofsegments plus the sum of MEX over all segments. Let's define the value of an array b_1, b_2, â€¦, b_k as the maximum possible cost over allpartitions of this array.

    You are given an array a of size n. Find the sum of values of all its subsegments.

    An array x is a subsegment of an array y if x can be obtained from y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning andseveral (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

[34m    Input:
[0m
    The input contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1 â‰¤t â‰¤30)Â â€” the number of test cases.
[0m
    The first line for each test case contains one integer n (1 â‰¤n â‰¤100)Â â€” the length of the array.
[0m
    The second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 â‰¤a_i â‰¤10^9)Â â€” the array elements.
[0m
    It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases does not exceed 100.

[34m    Output:
[0m
    For each test case print a single integerÂ â€” the answer to the problem.
